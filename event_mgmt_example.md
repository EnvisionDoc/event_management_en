# Example scenario

The following configuration topics are based on this example scenario. In this scenairo, the events are generated for the wind turbine state measuring point. You can perform configuration for other events such as remote signal displacement by referencing this is sample scenario.

The following table shows a list of wind turbine states and the corresponding events:
