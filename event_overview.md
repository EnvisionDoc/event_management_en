# Event management overview

The EnOS Event Management service enables you to receive, process, and generate events on your devices. The service also allows you to define event triggering rules against the device data, to achieve real-time alarming and troubleshooting.

## Key concepts

An _event_ is a record generated by the system when the value of a  measuring point in a certain domain reaches a specific condition.

The condition that triggers the event is the _event rule_. What's generated by the system is the _event content_. As measuring points or events may vary, to distinguish and manage the events more effectively, events are usually classified into _event groups_.

The events on EnOS are typically classified based on the _severity_ (such as danger, critical, error, warning, and information) and _type_ (such as over-limit).


The event management message flow and the key concepts are illustrated in the following figure:

## Major functions

**Forward event data to EnOS in a standard data structure**

The event management service defines standard event data structure and event receiving interfaces to allow event data to be transmitted to EnOS cloud at the real-time or in batch processing mode. For the EnOS cloud to be able to process the event data, you must use the Event Management service to define the standard event data structure that is accepted by EnOS

**Support defining event triggering rules and generated contents**

The Event Management service allows you to define event triggering rules for specific data measuring points of a domain. For example, you can define an over-limit rule which triggers an event when the value of the measuring point exceeds a threshold.

For devices such as wind turbines, photovoltaic inverter , and booster stations, you can define event triggering rules for data acquisition points, for example, when the engine room temperature exceeds 45 degrees centigrade or when a short-circuit occurs in the booster station, to meet the real-time monitoring requirements and subsequent diagnosis and troubleshooting requirements.

As the same time, you can define event groups according to best practices. For example, you can define event types such as communication abnormality and performance degrading. And you can define the typical event severities: information, warning, and error according to your business requirements.

**Support query, subscription, push event data from EnOS**

Event Management provide APIs for event data related actions such as querying, subscribing, and pushing events. You can develop your own alarm application or perform analytics based on these APIs. By subscribing to events and integrating with e-mail service or message service, you can also develop your own alarm applications such as alarm pop-ups, real-time and historical alarm inquiry, and e-mail and message alarm alerts.

**Support integrating 3rd-party event data**

EnOS can also accept event data generated from third-party systems. For example, in the shipbuilding industry, the on-site SCADA can forward the event data received from the ship communication network to EnOS in a standard event data format. You can then use EnOS event management service APIs for your event related applications.

**Note**

For devices connected through MQTT, events are not generated by default even after you configure the event triggering rules for the devices. To generate events for such devices, the event engine must be configured, please contact your Envision project manager or system administration for event engine configuration requests.
